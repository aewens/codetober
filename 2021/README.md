# Codetober 2021

This is my first year trying out this idea, so it will be interesting to see 
what it turns into by the time the month ends. Right now I have a few different 
goals and objectives I want to make out of this, and to help stick to them it 
would probably help to write them down.

## Objectives

My primary objective is to make at least one commit each day from October 1st 
to October 31st. This in itself would be boring without some goal, so my 
secondary objective is to write a library/framework I can use for future 
projects. In honor of this being done for "Codetober" in a month known for 
being spooky, I'll call this project "spirit" for now to keep in the _spirit_ 
of things (cue audience laughter).

For **Project Spirit**, I will start by trying to accomplish the following and 
slowly add more goals to this list as I make progress. Do note, accomplishing 
all is not the expectation of this activity, but merely a direction to head 
towards. I will note that I got started on this at the beginning of this week 
already to get a feel for what I wanted, so the first day it will *appear* like 
I did a lot when the efforts today will be minimal in comparison.

Goals:
- ~~Create an event store that can capture and replay events~~
- ~~Create an abstraction for observing when a value is changed~~
- ~~Connect the observable values to the event store to monitor their changes~~
- ~~Create a database wrapper for working with SQLite3~~
- ~~Create a general data model for passing around data~~
- ~~Use data models to create simple and minimal ORM for database wrapper~~
- Connect event store and observable values to ORM
- Add validators to ORM to ensure data integrity
- Add system to spawn worker child processes
- Create a job scheduler system

Bonus Goals:
- Create tests for project components
- Create documentation for project and its components
